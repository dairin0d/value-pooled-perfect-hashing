# ~~Value-pooled perfect hashing~~

Update: This idea is known as ["Magic Bitboards"](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Magic_Bitboards) in chess programming, where hash collisions are used to compress possible moves.

This repository is now moot, but for historical purposes I'll probably keep it around in case some curious soul comes up with the same question.

The old notes that were here previously were moved to the [corresponding file](old_notes.md).
